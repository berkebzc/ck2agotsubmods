<summary>This mod adds</summary>

* Olive Orchards in Meereen.
* Qartheen Markets in Qarth.
* Whaler Ports in Ibben.
* Arbor Vineyards in the Arbor. This building is specific to castles in the Arbor as towns already have wineries, and because the Arbor shipyards do not add any tax income.
* Grand Markets in Yi Ti's major cities, as they are described as market towns. Useful if you enjoy playing in the Far East.
* Myrish Guilds and Tyroshi Mercantiles in Myr and Tyrosh. As these provinces are republics, it made sense to add them only to the city holdings.
* Rainwood Forests in the Rainwood duchy region, as this region is famous for its lumber and more.
* Jonquil's Pool in Maidenpool. This building gives little income, but makes up for it by adding fertility and health boosts to its holder.
* Oldtown Harbors specific to the Hightower and the city of Oldtown itself.
* the Old Mint and Merman Guilds to White Harbor. Both are specific to the castle and city holdings.
* Lannisport Guilds noted for their goldworks to Lannisport.
* Pentoshi Bazaars owned by the Spicers to the city of Pentos.
